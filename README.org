* Codility Demonstration Programming Problems

I've taken a crack at a few of the [[http://codility.com/][Codility]] algorithms problems,
starting with 'equi', which you can read more about [[http://blog.codility.com/2011/03/solutions-for-task-equi.html][here]].

Each problem will include a unit test or two for starters, and the
test suites will hopefully grow from there.

The testing criteria also include requirements that the
implementations submitted fall within certain complexity bounds. I'll
begin by focussing on correct, tested implementations, and only then
worry about algorithmic efficiency.
